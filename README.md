# VerifyNews
VerifyNews - A Fake News Detector using Python and Flask is used to predict whether a given piece of news is fake or real.
## Overview

This project is a fake news detector web application built using Python and Flask framework. It provides users with a platform to enter news articles and determine whether they are likely to be fake or real based on various factors.

## Features

- **Text Analysis**: Utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of news articles.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Incorporates a pre-trained machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real.
- **User Interface**: Offers a user-friendly web interface for users to input news articles and view the classification results.
- **Feedback System**: Allows users to provide feedback on the classification results to improve the model's accuracy over time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Visual Studio Code (or any preferred text editor)
- Flask library (`pip install flask`)
- Other required libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, pandas, etc.)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone or download the project repository to your local machine.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory. Install the required Python packages using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. **Run the Application**: In the terminal, run the following command to start the Flask server:
python app.py

4. **Access the Web App**: Once the server is running, open a web browser and navigate to the URL provided by Flask (usually `http://localhost:5000`).

## Usage
